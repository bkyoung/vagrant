Contained in the directory is everything you need to deploy an Ubuntu 13.04 Server with:
  * puppet 
  * ruby-1.9.3-p392 (hand compiled)

To take advantage of this convenience, ensure the following are installed:
  * Virtual Box (http://virtualbox.org)
  * Vagrant (http://vagrantup.com)

Once these prerequisites are installed, simply:
  $~> vagrant up
  ... wait until it indicates things are finished
  $~> vagrant ssh
